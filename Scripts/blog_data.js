Of course, I have to give credit to the one and only <b>Bob‚Äôs Game Shack</b> who gave me the idea to create my own.<br><br>This year saw a massive growth. I don‚Äôt have any numbers or exact data for last school year because I didn‚Äôt have analytics yet, but I already know this school year is much higher. I can‚Äôt thank you enough for all the support and growth that this site has received and I‚Äôm excited going into 2023 with new ideas and features planned.</li></ul><br><h3>Numbers (9/1 - 12/30)</h3><b>‚Ä¢ 379,000+ Views</b><br><b>‚Ä¢ 11,000+ Users (~92% of which in Northern VA)</b><br><b>‚Ä¢ 14m 22s Average Engagement Time</b><br><br><b>In over:</b><br><b>‚Ä¢ 9 Countries</b><br><b>‚Ä¢ 38 States + DC (USA)</b><br><b>‚Ä¢ 7+ Different Languages</b>",

        text: "Alrighty, if you read my last blog then you would know about version 6 and my plans and ideas for it. This is kind of like an update of that, just a few small leaks. With the current progress I‚Äôve made, I wouldn‚Äôt expect the update until winter break, most likely the first week. So next week. Now for the part, you‚Äôre most interested in.</li></ul><br><h3>Game Icons</h3>If you‚Äôve seen the message or the post on my forums then you would know that the game icons are getting redesigned majorly. This features a new background image design with the text over the image with a slight shadow. Personally, I think it looks nice but I can imagine some people not liking it so please give me feedback on it cause I might add a feature, later on, to change it to the current one if that‚Äôs your style. You can find an image of that here on my forums (post your feedback there too): https://sgs.peerboard.com/post/1209711015</li></ul><br><h3>Blogs</h3>Now, most people usually don‚Äôt read these blogs, except maybe you reading this lol, but I still see it as an important piece of the site as it can provide important information and talk about leaks like this. The blog page is more straightforward, even though I just redesigned it like two updates ago. There‚Äôs a separate area for all the update logs so you don‚Äôt mix them up, and I‚Äôve just put all the regular blogs below it. The new design features a simple box with the title, author, date, and now a short description of what each blog is about and a new read button under that. Not much else has changed except for some more integration with headings and other text features.<br><br>This is all I have so far to share with you. I am still working on many features to hopefully be finishing soon. Like I said before, please provide me with some feedback on the leaks that were mentioned above and what you would like to see added to the shack. I look forward to releasing this update soon, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what you think of it!<br><br><i>*Additionally, I just rolled out a hotfix for a bug with the search</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Patrick is a rat üêÄ",

        text: "So I basically got bored and started thinking of what to do next. Honestly, just thinking about adding games and some new features makes me not want to work on the site for some reason, and I get pulled into thinking about how I could improve the site even better. This led me to think about version 6, the next big update to Syce‚Äôs Game Shack!<br><br>And yes I know there haven‚Äôt been any updates recently and that‚Äôs because of school and stuff. You can read more about why and stuff in my forms: https://sgs.peerboard.com/post/1933814057. Yes, this will continue to be the same until the update most likely, so don‚Äôt get your hopes up for an update before version 6.</li></ul><br><h3>What To Expect</h3>I wouldn‚Äôt expect too much from any major site update. As mentioned before, updates are usually just features and stuff, and not anything different. So why not refresh the site a little bit every once in a while to make it seem new?<br><br>In this update, I plan on redesigning some major components of the site including the overhaul of some pages to give them a new fresh look. Almost think about it as version 4 (which was a massive rewrite) except not as insane and more modern. Of course, I still plan on adding features and some games to go along with this but I‚Äôm more so focusing on the design.</li></ul><br><h3>What for Now?</h3>For now, you can just wait and continue playing as always. I wouldn‚Äôt say this would take that long, maybe a few weeks at most, sometime in December. I‚Äôm totally open to suggestions, you can suggest through the game suggestion link (which will change to accept features) or my peerboard: https://sgs.peerboard.com. Anyways, I hope you‚Äôll like the refresh and I‚Äôll continue to do this every once in a while.",
