        text: "Alrighty, if you read my last blog then you would know about version 6 and my plans and ideas for it. This is kind of like an update of that, just a few small leaks. With the current progress I’ve made, I wouldn’t expect the update until winter break, most likely the first week. So next week. Now for the part, you’re most interested in.<br><br><b>Game Icons</b><br>If you’ve seen the message or the post on my forums then you would know that the game icons are getting redesigned majorly. This features a new background image design with the text over the image with a slight shadow. Personally, I think it looks nice but I can imagine some people not liking it so please give me feedback on it cause I might add a feature, later on, to change it to the current one if that’s your style. You can find an image of that here on my forums (post your feedback there too): https://sgs.peerboard.com/post/1209711015<br><br><b>Blogs</b><br>Now, most people usually don’t read these blogs, except maybe you reading this lol, but I still see it as an important piece of the site as it can provide important information and talk about leaks like this. The blog page is more straightforward, even though I just redesigned it like two updates ago. There’s a separate area for all the update logs so you don’t mix them up, and I’ve just put all the regular blogs below it. The new design features a simple box with the title, author, date, and now a short description of what each blog is about and a new read button under that. Not much else has changed except for some more integration with headings and other text features.<br><br>This is all I have so far to share with you. I am still working on many features to hopefully be finishing soon. Like I said before, please provide me with some feedback on the leaks that were mentioned above and what you would like to see added to the shack. I look forward to releasing this update soon, and I can’t wait to see what you think of it!<br><br><i>*Additionally, I just rolled out a hotfix for a bug with the search</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Patrick is a rat 🐀",

        text: "So I basically got bored and started thinking of what to do next. Honestly, just thinking about adding games and some new features makes me not want to work on the site for some reason, and I get pulled into thinking about how I could improve the site even better. This led me to think about version 6, the next big update to Syce’s Game Shack!<br><br>And yes I know there haven’t been any updates recently and that’s because of school and stuff. You can read more about why and stuff in my forms: https://sgs.peerboard.com/post/1933814057. Yes, this will continue to be the same until the update most likely, so don’t get your hopes up for an update before version 6.<br><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>I wouldn’t expect too much from any major site update. As mentioned before, updates are usually just features and stuff, and not anything different. So why not refresh the site a little bit every once in a while to make it seem new?<br><br>In this update, I plan on redesigning some major components of the site including the overhaul of some pages to give them a new fresh look. Almost think about it as version 4 (which was a massive rewrite) except not as insane and more modern. Of course, I still plan on adding features and some games to go along with this but I’m more so focusing on the design.<br><br><b>What for Now?</b><br>For now, you can just wait and continue playing as always. I wouldn’t say this would take that long, maybe a few weeks at most, sometime in December. I’m totally open to suggestions, you can suggest through the game suggestion link (which will change to accept features) or my peerboard: https://sgs.peerboard.com. Anyways, I hope you’ll like the refresh and I’ll continue to do this every once in a while.",

Read below for more details:<br><br><b>Security Updates</b><br>• Removed Adventure Capitalist as GitHub's Dependabot found <b>61 vulnerable dependencies</b> with some being critical.<br>ㅤ◦ I'm aware that this may of been actively exploited.<br><br><b>Changes</b><br>• Changed the scaling on the home page, should look better on smaller/bigger resolution devices.<br>• Fixed a few grammar and spelling errors, but there's still probably a lot more.<br>• Experimenting with a few other scaling things, the site should look a lot better on some devices.<br><br><b>Performance</b><br>• Increased the performance when playing games. This was mainly noticeable on mobile cause it was literal garbage before the update.<br><br><b>Known Issues</b><br>• When loading the site, you may see the site glitch before completely loading with no loading screen. (26911389)<br>• Scaling may be a problem with certain elements on bigger/smaller resolution devices. (34482888)<br>ㅤ◦ <b>Workaround:</b> Scale up/down the page using zoom. Not available on mobile.<br>• If you scroll down and reload, the loading screen doesn't fade out and is seen fading out at the top of the page. (49867091)<br>• Sometimes when clicking off the game splash screen thing, you would end up viewing a different game's splash screen. (44939979)<br>• On some devices, game descriptions might be too long that they get cut off, and/or the play button, at the bottom of the page. (79099003)<br>ㅤ◦ <b>Workaround:</b> Scale the page down. Not available on mobile.<br>• None of the site icons, including the cloak icons, show up. (52999265)<br><br><b>Resolved Issues</b><br>• Most noticeably on mobile, when you switch to the gamepage after being focused on the iframe, it would not re-show the scrollbar sometimes.(73980552)<br>ㅤ◦ <b>Solution:</b> Make it re-show in the script for going back to the gamepage.",

        text: `<b>What's new?</b><br>• Completely rewritten the website to fit a better design and functionality<br>ㅤ◦ New aesthetic home screen, to show version 4 at a quick glance.<br>ㅤ◦ New sidebar on the left to switch to the different pages, now including two new ones.<br>ㅤ◦ Added light mode, turn it on at the bottom of the sidebar.<br>ㅤ◦ New view before you enter a game, shows you the description of the game, as well as the genre and publisher.<br>ㅤ◦ New loading screen for the site with a new animation.<br>ㅤ◦ Plus many other small design changes.<br><br>Everything was rewritten in a way to work better than before which makes it easier for other things in the future to be added on.<br><br><b>Performance</b><br>• This update includes many things to help performance. With the new ways the site works, some stuff like the loading might be a bit slower because of how I did it, but there's some things that I've improved in this update that will definitely help with that and other things.<br>ㅤ◦ Firstly, to better improve loading times I've realized the site takes the longest to load all the icons, so why not just show them? That's why I've included a new settings to disable the game icons from showing which definitely makes the site load much quicker. Would recommend it if you have a slow laptop/computer and/or a slow internet connection.<br>ㅤ◦ Probably one of the biggest changes in this update is that games now run on the same page with the gamepage meaning there's no loading between launching a game or going back to the gamepage. Unlike before where it would have to load the entire gamepage after you exited out of a game.<br><br><b>Known Issues</b><br>• When loading the site, you may see the site glitch before completely loading with no loading screen.
