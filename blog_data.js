With the new ways the site works, some stuff like the loading might be a bit slower because of how I did it, but there's some things that I've improved in this update that will definitely help with that and other things.<br>ㅤ◦ Firstly, to better improve loading times I've realized the site takes the longest to load all the icons, so why not just show them? That's why I've included a new settings to disable the game icons from showing which definitely makes the site load much quicker. Would recommend it if you have a slow laptop/computer and/or a slow internet connection.<br>ㅤ◦ Probably one of the biggest changes in this update is that games now run on the same page with the gamepage meaning there's no loading between launching a game or going back to the gamepage. Unlike before where it would have to load the entire gamepage after you exited out of a game.<br><br><b>Known Issues</b><br>• When loading the site, you may see the site glitch before completely loading with no loading screen.
